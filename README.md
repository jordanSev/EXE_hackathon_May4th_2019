The project that won 2nd in the Star Wars Themed Texas State EXE hackon in 2019. Includes an opening crawl reminiscent of the star wars opening crawl, followed by a 3d deathstar that pivots back and forth. It shoots a laser and plays a sound with the spacebar.
The Starwars theme and the laser sound effects are owned by Disney, I am using them to pay homage to the starwars franchise. I do not own
the copyright to any startwars property.
